placeholder-pollyfill
=====================

A simple, jQuery-based placeholder polyfill that gracefully handles password fields.

To use it, simply include it in your project with a script tag. It doesn't live-query, it'll just create placeholders for all the inputs that exist on the page on initialization.

Focused towards reliable handling of password fields in IE.
